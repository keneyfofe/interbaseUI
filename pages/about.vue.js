I am a dedicated, proficient, and certified Java Developer
with three years of experience in software development 
within telecommunications and financial industries.
I have worked on a couple of projects with the  customize
POS applications being the most outstanding.

I do possess 12 years experience in mechanical engineering
which enabled my switch in career from 
mechanical engineering to software engineering a seamless 
process. This transition has enabled me to merge my technical
industrial experience with software development bespoke practices. 
I strive for new knowledge, information and personal development.

<p>
As a Project manager by Qualification,I am very cognisant of 
the triple constraints that may affect project deliverables 
and the need to collaborate as a team with the help of project 
and process management tools such as Agile/Scrum and Jira that 
supports an iterative and incremental approach to
Software development and  management lifecycle.
I seek to join a reputable and forward thinking organisation 
where I can fully comit myself,render my services to the best of 
my ability,and be willing to learn as well as contribute in the 
growth success pf the business.
